A                       is a suite of programs for constructing and maintaining the database and for offering ad hoc query facilities to multiple users and applications.
database management system (DBMS)
In a            columns are referred to as attributes.
relational database
A     is the result of a query that returns selected rows and columns from one or more tables.
view
          is a standardized language that can be used to define schema, manipulate, and query data in a relational database.
Structured query language
With         administration the owner (creator) of a table may grant and revoke access rights to the table.
ownership-based
In a          administration a small number of privileged users may grant and revoke access rights.
centralized
In addition to granting and revoking access rights to a table, in a         administration the owner of the table may grant and revoke authorization rights to other users, allowing them to grant and revoke access rights to the table.
decentralized
In a discretionary access control environment database users are classified into three broad categories: administrator, end user other than application owner, and           .
application owner
The information transfer path by which unauthorized data is obtained is referred to as an            channel.
inference
The        attack typically works by prematurely terminating a text string and appending a new command.
SQLi
The           form of attack injects code in one or more conditional statements so they always evaluate to true.
tautology
A         language provides a uniform interface to the database for users and applications.
query
        , out-of-band, and inferential are the three main categories of SQLi attack types.
In-band
A            is an enterprise facility that houses a large number of servers, storage devices, and network switches and equipment.
data center
The Telecommunications Industry Association standard            specifies the minimum requirements for telecommunications infrastructure of data centers.
